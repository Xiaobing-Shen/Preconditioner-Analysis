MIQR: a multilevel incomplete QR preconditioner for large sparse
least-squares problems

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The main program  reads a list of matrices [file:  matfile] and a list
of options [file: inputs] and executes CGNR + preconditioned with MIQR
for a number of cases [see input file/]

The example provided  is from the animal breeding  example -- obtained
from CERFACS. All matrices are in Harwell-boeing format..

Abstract:

The algorithm builds the factorization by exploiting structural orthogonality
in general sparse matrices. At any given step, the algorithm finds an
independent set of columns, i.e., a set of columns that have orthogonal
patterns. The other columns are then block orthogonalized against columns of
the independent set and the process is repeated recursively for a certain
number of levels on these remaining columns. The final level matrix is
processed with a standard QR or Incomplete QR factorization. Dropping
strategies are employed throughout the levels in order to maintain a good
level of sparsity. A few improvements to this basic scheme are explored.
Among these is the relaxation of the requirement of independent sets of
columns.
